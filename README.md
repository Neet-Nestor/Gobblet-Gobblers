# Gobblet-Gobblers

Gobblet Gobblers is an enhanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that introduces variable piece sizes and stacking mechanics, adding depth and strategy to a familiar format. Players compete to align three of their pieces in a row on a 3x3 board, where each player can "gobble" smaller pieces with larger ones, dynamically changing the board state.
